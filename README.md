Golang package implementing the CDXJ file format used by OpenWayback
3.0.0 (and later) to index web archive contents (notably in WARC and
ARC files) and make them searchable via a resource resolution service.
The format builds on the CDX file format originally developed by the
Internet Archive for the indexing behind the WaybackMachine. This
specification builds on it by simplifying the primary fields while
adding a flexible JSON 'block' to each record, allowing high
flexiblity in the inclusion of additional data.
